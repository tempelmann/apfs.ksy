### iBored

The free disk editor [iBored](http://apps.tempel.org/iBored) adds support for APFS volumes in version 1.2. While it does currently not read this ksy file for its templates feature, its templates.xml file is modeled (manually) after this ksy file.

Get the latest beta (1.2b6 or higher) from here: http://files.tempel.org/iBored â€“ note that these beta versions may contain support only for APFS, whereas the official (older) release supports many other formats (FAT, HFS etc.).

To use iBored, drop a disk image file such as the provided .dd files into its window, or type shift+cmd+R to relaunch iBored with root permissions so that you can see the volumes of installed disks. Then double click it to see the first block in structured layout.
